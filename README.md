New assignments should hold the same structure as the assignments above.
***src*** is the folder containing your code files.
***bin*** is the folder for your compiled files, but the compiled files should not be uploaded.
After you have pulled your repository the fist time you need to go in to the [.gitignore](.gitignore) and remove the # before bin/ (line 8 and 50).
The ***README.md*** is a file where your write a short explanation of what your program does.

#### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Remember this :heavy_exclamation_mark:

```clang

```
